# What is the purpuse of this project 


the genesis of this project come from this youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxnKeTL2I6E) where a tech journalist explain how speed test working and at the same time i have some wi-fi problem. So i use my program and data knowledge in order to track the speed quality of the network where i'am connected. I choose the speedtest from cloudflare for this project and ipinfo.io in order to retreive some information about the network (localisation ...)
